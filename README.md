# CW2 Pitch

Student ID: 10752010

Pitch Idea:
I plan to create a simple scene in OpenGL which allows a user to view some spinning cubes which each have a texture loaded and displayed onto them.
If I have the time, I will also try to incorporate a way for the user to rotate the camera which will change the location/orientation of the cubes on the screen.
